                                    <p>We may employ third party companies and individuals to facilitate our Service (&#8220;Service Providers&#8221;), to provide the Service on our behalf, to perform Service-related services or to assist us in analyzing how our Service is used.</p>
                                    <p>These third parties have access to your Personal Data only to perform these tasks on our behalf and are obligated not to disclose or use it for any other purpose.</p>
                                    <p>By using our apps and not choosing one of the opt-out options, you give us consent to transfer your data as stated below.</p>
                                    <p>We will pass the device-level data (for example if a device has clicked on a sports ad within our apps) as well as we may pass age &amp; gender information to our advertising partners « Service Providers» and they can reuse such data for targeted advertising.</p>
                                    <p>Advertisers may choose their audience by location, demographics, likes, keywords, age &amp; gender, interests, behaviors, connections and any other information. We cooperate with several Service Providers of IBA.</p>
                                    <p>We disclose the information to our advertising and analytics partners so that we can display advertisements and analyze the usage.</p>
                                    <p>We cannot provide all services necessary for the successful operation of the Applications or the Website by ourselves.

We may share information that can be used to personally identify your device (e.g. persistent identifiers such as IDFA, IDFV, advertising ID and IP address) for the purposes of delivering our services, displaying advertisements, conducting analysis and research and for measuring our advertising campaign performance.</p>

                                    <p>We strive to commit our Service Providers to using the information solely for the purposes as stated above. If they use information that might be considered as personal information, they should use it solely for the purposes of contextual advertising, but for any other purposes they should use the information solely on aggregated basis. Notwithstanding the above, we cannot guarantee that our Service Providers will adhere to the contractual obligations or acceptable business practices. While we strive to protect the information provided to our Service Providers, we have no direct control over their use of the collected information and therefore you acknowledge that we are not liable for any third party privacy breach and that our liability for our Service Providers breaches is limited to the amount we are able to receive as indemnification from our Service Providers (legal costs exempted).</p>
                                    <p>In addition, Service Providers may use their own tracking technologies (including and without limitation: cookies, Web beacons, HTTP cache, and local shared objects) to compile anonymous information about users of the Applications and visitors to the Websites. Service Providers may share anonymous information that they collect with their clients, including the date and time a banner ad was shown and the specific ad shown. We strive to ensure that this information is only disclosed to such third parties in an aggregated manner.</p>
                                    <p>Unlike the tracking technologies used by us in the content we control on the Website and in the Applications, we do not control or have access to the information collected by our Service Providers using their own tracking technologies. Their information gathering practices, including their policies regarding the use of cookies, Web beacons, and other tracking technologies, are governed by their own privacy policies, not this one. We strive to adhere to the generally accepted industry practices regarding the collection and the usage of information by our Partners and to limit their usage to the services they provide for us.</p>
                                    <p>Some of the Applications allow you to submit content generated in or by the Applications to third party sites like Google Play Games and YouTube.
